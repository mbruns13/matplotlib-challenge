## Observations and Insights 

*Write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data*

1. There is a strong positive correlation between average tumor volume and mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen
2. Capomulin and Ramicane seem to be more effective than Infubinol and Ceftamin. The IQR for the final tumor volume under Capomulin and Ramicane falls below the mean and median tumor volume for those drug regimens overall. Contrastingly, The IQR for the final tumor volume under Infubinol and Ceftamin falls above the overall mean and median tumor volume for these drug regimens.
3. The above difference between Capomulin & Ramicane and Infubinol & Ceftamin could be related to the difference in total number of timepoints for all mice tested within those drug regimens; Infubinol and Ceftamin had fewer total timepoints than Capomulin and Ramicane.
